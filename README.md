# Description
This is my web Portfolio built using React. Here, I have displayed seven of my favorite projects to code during my time at the University
of Arizona Coding Bootcamp. On my site, you may also check out the links to my Github and LinkedIn profiles, my resume, and my contact information.
Please enjoy these projects as much as I did while coding them!
